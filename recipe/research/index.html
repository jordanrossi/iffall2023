    <h1>Banana Bread Recipe</h1>
    <p>
        This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads of banana flavor. Why compromise the
        banana flavor? Friends and family love my recipe and say it's by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted.
        Enjoy!

            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C):</b>
                
                Butter an 8x4-inch loaf pan.
                
            </li>
            <li><b>Mash the bananas and add the butter:</b>
                
                In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into
                the
                mashed bananas.
        
            </li>
            <li><b>Mix in the remaining ingredients:</b>
            
                Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.
                
            </li>
            <li><b>Bake the bread:</b>
                
                Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan.
                Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350째F (175째C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the
                center
                comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is
                browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf
                is
                fully baked.
                
            </li>
            <li><b>Cool and serve:</b>
                
                Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan
                and
                let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't
                crumbly.)
                Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate
                the
                loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.

        <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus">Epicurious</a> does a great job of presenting a photo along
        with all the information necessary to cook the meal. I also like the hierarchy that is given throughout the

        <br>
        <a href="https://www.delish.com">Delish</a> does a great job of providing all the necessary ingredients needed
        for the recipe. However, they don't provide a lot of detail or pictures to help the reader understand the
        directions of making the dish.
