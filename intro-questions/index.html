        <ol> 
            <li>Jordan Rossi, Communication Design, Junior</li>
            <li>I have taken CSE 131 in the past and I have to take this class as a requirement for my communication design major and HCI minor. </li>
            <li>I have used Java in CSE 131 and was briefly introduced to HTML in Type I last year.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn more about how to use HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li>I need to think of the details in creating headers, paragraphs, fonts, etc.</li>
            <li>https://www.flyhyer.com/about-us shows effective design because the layouts of certain information is very easy to find and the website does a great job of dividing certain sections up so that they can correlate with the photos being displayed. </li>
            <li>https://www.metmuseum.org shows effective communication because they do a great job of using the tabs to help the readers indicate certain parts of the museum. Also, they do a great job of using photos next to the description so that the readers have an understanding of what a certain exhibition looks like. </li>
            <li>https://www.audemarspiguet.com/com/en/home.html works well because it displays all the necessary information for luxury watches and goes into specific detail on what is involved with each watch, including showing pictures of the parts. There is also a unique design, where photos and text are placed very effectively so that it provides some unique layouts across the website.</li>
