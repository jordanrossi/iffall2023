            <h2>Monitored Breeding Farms</h2>
            <p>Parmigiano Reggiano is produced exclusively in the provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna to the left of the Reno river, and Mantua to the right of the Po river: this is the area hosting the farms where the cattle are fed on locally grown forage. The feeding of cattle complies with the norms of a strict specification that bans the use of silage, fermented feeds and animal flour.</p>

            <h2>The Production</h2>
            <p>The milk from the morning and the previous evening is poured into the traditional upturned bell-shaped copper vats. It takes about 550 litres of milk to produce each wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano. The milk slowly and naturally coagulates with the addition of rennet and a whey starter, rich in starter cultures, from the previous day’s processing.</p>

                <p>The curd which forms is then broken down by the master cheese-maker into minuscule granules using a traditional tool called “spino”.</p>
        
                <p>This is where fire comes into the picture, in a cooking process which reaches 55 degrees centigrade, after which the cheesy granules sink to the bottom of the cauldron forming a single mass.</p>
        
                <p>After about fifty minutes the cheese-maker removes the cheese mass which will give rise to two twin wheels.
        
                <p>Cut into two parts and wrapped in the typical linen cloth, the cheese is then placed in a mould which will give it its final shape.

            <h2>Marks of Origin</h2>
            <p>A casein plate with a unique and sequential alphanumeric code is applied to each wheel: it is its identity card which makes it possible to trace its entire production back to its origins, anytime and anywhere.</p>

            <p>After a few hours, a special marking band engraves the month and year of production onto the cheese, as well as its cheese factory registration number and the unmistakable dotted inscriptions around the complete circumference of the cheese wheel.

            <h2>The Salting</h2>
            <p>After a few days, the wheels are immersed in a saturated solution of water and salt: it is a process of salting by osmosis. This last passage closes the production cycle of Parmigiano Reggiano and starts its maturation period. </p>

            <h2>The Importance of Time</h2>
            <p>
            The story of Parmigiano-Reggiano is a long one, and also a slow one, following the natural rhythm of the seasons.</p>

            <p>In fact, the minimum maturation time is 12 months, the longest among all the PDO cheeses, and only at this point can it be decided if each individual wheel is worthy of the name it was given at its birth, and therefore continue the maturation up to 24, 36, 40 months and more.

            <h2>The Quality Inspection</h2>
            <p>
            After 12 months, the Consortium experts carry out a test called “quality inspection” on all the wheels: each wheel is tapped with a hammer and the trained ear of the quality inspector recognises any defects inside the cheese that may compromise quality.</p>

            <p>The conforming wheels are marked with the hot-iron brand thus becoming Parmigiano Reggiano. All identifying marks and signs are removed from any wheels which do not meet the PDO requirements.

            <h2>Grade Selection Marks</h2>
            <p>The quality control identifies three cheese categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“first-grade” Parmigiano Reggiano: the cheese that fully complies with the production specifications. It is marked with the hot-iron brand.</li>
                <li>“medium-grade” Parmigiano Reggiano: the cheese that shows minor or moderate defects in the structure of its paste and/or on the rind, yet that do not alter the typical organoleptic characteristics of the product. These wheels are marked with the hot-iron brand, but they can be recognised through the parallel grooves engraved all around the cheese rind.</li>
                <li>“de-rinded” cheese: the cheese that shows major defects is downgraded by eliminating the marks of origin through the removal of the rind (a few millimetres). Therefore, this cheese cannot be called Parmigiano Reggiano and refer to the PDO in any way.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A Further Selection: “Premium” and “Export” Marks</h2>
            <p>Starting from the 18th month of maturation, dairies may request the Consortium to affix an additional mark on first-grade Parmigiano Reggiano:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PREMIUM or EXPORT mark: it gives trading companies and consumers a further indication of the quality of Parmigiano Reggiano.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> These marks can be affixed also on the packaging of the cheese selected in this way.</p>
