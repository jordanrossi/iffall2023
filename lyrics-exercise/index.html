                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                
                <p> Midnight</p>
                
                <p>You come and pick me up, no headlights</p>
                
                <p>A long drive</p>
                
                <p>Could end in burning flames or paradise</p>
                
                <p>Fade into view, oh</p>
                
                <p> It's been a while since I have even heard from you</p>
                
                <p>(Heard from you)</p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
                
                <p>And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I</p>
                
                <p>Know exactly where it leads, but I</p>
                
                <p>Watch us go 'round and 'round each time</p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Chorus</h3>

                <p>You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye</p>
                
                <p> And I got that red lip classic thing that you like</p>
                
                <p> And when we go crashing down, we come back every time</p>
                
                <p>  'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style</p>
                
                <p>  You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt</p>
                
                <p> And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt</p>
                
                <p>And when we go crashing down, we come back every time</p>
                
                <p>'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style</p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Verse 2</h3>

               <p>So it goes</p>
                
               <p>He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm</p>
                
               <p>Takes me home</p>
                
               <p>The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mmm, yeah</p>
                
               <p>I say, "I heard, oh"</p>
                
               <p>That you've been out and about with some other girl"</p>

                <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
                
                <p>He says, "What you heard is true, but I</p>
                
                <p>Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"</p>
                
                <p>I said, "I've been there too a few times"</p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Chorus</h3>

                <p>You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt</p>
                
                <p> And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A light little skirt)</p>
                
                <p>  And when we go crashing down, we come back every time</p>
                
                <p>  'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)</p>
                
                <p>  We never go out of style</p>
                <br>
